      "I'm Melinda. For the last year, I have been building software with React, Apollo and GraphQL. Recently I have adopted TypeScript. I’ve had the opportunity to design and develop my own features. On the side, I have taught myself how to build cross-platform mobile apps with React Native.",
      "What I enjoy about development is bringing together design with code. For me, there isn’t a better feeling than creating something from nothing. I get excited about coding a beautiful UI and I can honestly say that I love CSS. That’s why I specialize in front-end development.",
      "Before I got into software, I worked for a web design company for three years building websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or with WordPress. While working full time, I was growing my skills as a developer. Previously I was a marketing manager for a group of surgeons. After graduating from art school, I ran my own photography business.",
      "While I spend much of my free time learning, I also regularly attend local tech meetups. I have volunteered to give presentations about JavaScript and share my knowledge with other developers. Along with other women leaders, I helped re-launch the women in tech meetup in Asheville. Besides coding, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and photography."
